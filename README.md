#Engineering thesis: System facilitating blind people to use means of public transport

System consists 2 devices: transmitting device & receiving device. Transmitting device is placed in autobus and is sending number & direction of the line. Second one is receiving device, which is used by blind person. The blind person after choosing the bus number gets a voice information about the bus, that has come to bus stop. Both devices include Atmel ATmega32 microcontroller. The code documentation (comments) has been made in Polish language just because that was my engineering thesis.

Technologies: C language, Atmel ATmega32, Bluetooth, PetitFAT, MP3, LCD 2x16, SPI, UART, RS232, pushbuttons.
